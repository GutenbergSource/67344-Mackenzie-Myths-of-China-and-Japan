<HTML><BODY>This 1923 book deals with the mythology (and wider culture) of China and Japan. Some footnotes, but no further difficulties. As usual in my projects, I've moved the unpaged illustrations to the end, and made high-resolution version available in the project files. The original scans are <a href="https://archive.org/details/mythsofchinajap00mack/page/n9">here</a>.

<p>Have Fun!
